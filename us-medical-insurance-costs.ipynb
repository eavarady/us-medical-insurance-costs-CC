    "\n",
    "This notebook explores a dataset of U.S. medical insurance records and summarizes patterns across demographic and lifestyle attributes. The analysis organizes the raw CSV data into Python lists and encapsulates common computations in a small utility class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset (insurance.csv) contains the following columns:\n",
    "- age (years)\n",
    "- sex (female/male)\n",
    "- bmi (body mass index)\n",
    "- children (number of dependents)\n",
    "- smoker (yes/no)\n",
    "- region (U.S. region)\n",
    "- charges (annual medical insurance cost in USD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Results include an average patient age, counts by sex, the set of unique regions represented, and an average annual insurance charge. A consolidated patient dictionary is also produced to facilitate later exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation notes are embedded as TODO comments in code cells."
